# Query Params Remover
## Remove fbclid and utm_ query params

This is working and usable right now. It still needs to be signed via addons.mozilla.org (AMO) before you can install it (permanently) locally or via the AMO site... just gonna do temporary loading for now via about:debugging. 

1. Go to about:debugging
2. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
3. Navigate to the folder where this extension is downloaded to
4. Double click on `manifest.json` and it should load and show up in your add-ons list

Note - Since this is just temporary loading, so it will be uninstalled every time the browser exits.
