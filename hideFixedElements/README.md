# Hide Fixed Elements
## Adds a button which can be clicked to make "fixed" elements (that is, headers/footers/sidebars that stay stuck to one part of the window) disappear, opening up more space to view the page content.

This is not my code. I just wanted to host this code so I can refer back to it.
